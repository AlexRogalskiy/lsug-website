# Coding with cats

## Blurb

Christmas is long gone, but it's never too late to celebrate functional
programming! And there's no better way to celebrate than by solving the Advent
of Code. Join us and have a crack at the first three advent of code
challenges. Starting with pure functions, recursion, collections and error
handling, we'll work our way up to using functional libraries such as
[cats](https://index.scala-lang.org/typelevel/cats),
[spire](https://index.scala-lang.org/typelevel/spire),
[monocle](https://index.scala-lang.org/julien-truffaut/monocle) and
[fs2](https://index.scala-lang.org/functional-streams-for-scala/fs2).

## Setup

This workshop requires a fair amount of dependencies, so try your best to set up before you arrive.
You can set up by cloning the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/lsug/advent-of-code-typelevel.git)
and follow the instructions on the `README`.

Donâ€™t hesitate to reach out to the Gitter channel if you have any problems.
