# Lessons learnt with van Laarhoven lenses

## Blurb

Sometimes called "The JQuery of DataTypes"; Lenses and other Optics provide a clean functional interface to the common task of modifying complex data structures. Brushing over any practical use cases, this talk takes a magnifying glass to one particular Optics representation; van Laarhoven Lenses.

# FP; The Good, the Bad and the Ugly

## Blurb

You are about to fall in love with Functional Programming, if not already. You are going to learn the good parts that are going to make your daily life easier.
But since nobody is perfect **not even FP**, you are also going to see its bad and ugly parts, and you'll discover how to deal with them: from learning challenges to performance issues on the JVM.
